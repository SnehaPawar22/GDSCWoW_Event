### Cloud Computing provides the services like

### PAAS(Platform as a service)
* To write a code we do install lots of tools for ex:- VS code editor, pycharm, notepad++ etc. PAAS helps us to write a code
  on a cloud. It gives us a platform where we can build the things and write code.
  ex:- In salesforce there is a force.com which is given by salesforce where we no need to install any editor to write a code
  force.com helps us to write a code on cloud. In salesforce we write the code in developer console.

  just internet and browser to use the application.

### IAAS(Infrastructure as a service)
* Its used to get hardware things from the cloud environment. for ex:- If we have any heavy datasets to load, if we have less storage in our
  local machine it takes hours together or half a day to process the things but with cloud IAAS service by paying to that service we get a virtual
  machine where we can scale up to higher processor to execute our things.
